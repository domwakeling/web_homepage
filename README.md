# Personalised Web Homepage

Project to try out the [eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator and also
build myself a personal "Welcome" page (planning on setting it as my browser home page).

Eleventy setup built from basics and deployed on Netlify.

Technologies used:
* Nunjucks templates (including for generating CSS)
* SVG/HTML/JavaScript for the
  [6015](https://wornandwound.com/review/affordable-vintage-seiko-6105/)-inspired watchface
* `dart-sass` to convert `SASS` to `CSS`, and then `clean-css` to minify
* `js-beautify` to generate clean, properly-indented HTML
