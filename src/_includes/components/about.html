    <p>
        Little project using a static site generator (<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>)
        to build a custom 'homepage' dashboard, including as many odd little widgets as I can
        think of.

        Code on a <a href="https://github.com/domwakeling/web_homepage">Github repo</a>,
        page is housed on Netlify and refreshed each day at 6am, midday and 6pm via Netlify Hooks.
