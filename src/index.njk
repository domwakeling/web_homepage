        <p>
            Little project using a static site generator (<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>)
            to build a custom 'homepage' dashboard, including as many odd little widgets as I can
            think of.
        </p>
        <p>
            Code on a <a href="https://github.com/domwakeling/web_homepage">Github repo</a>,
            page is housed on Netlify and refreshed at 6am each morning via a Netlify Hook.
