        <p>
            Little project using a static site generator (<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>)
            to build a custom 'homepage' dashboard, including as many odd little widgets as I can
            think of.
        </p>
        <p>
            Code on a <a href="https://github.com/domwakeling/web_homepage">Github repo</a>,
            page is housed on Netlify and refreshed at 6am each morning via a Netlify Hook.

        <h2>Regenerate</h2>
        <p>
            Use the button below to trigger a fresh "build" of the website on Netlify (takes circa
            30 seconds, and you'll need to refresh the page).
